# Micro-Controller-one-way-traffic-light-
Exercise on one way traffic lighting.
The BRD file uses the code to help us simulate our Arduino circuit board online.
All LEDs are connected to the Ground pin and each are connected to a resistor to protect it from a damaging current.
RED LED is connectet to pin 13, YELLOW LED to pin 12 and GREEN LED to pin 11.
Our code is comprising of a void loop which uses a digitalwrite and delay function to turn the LEDs on and off for 1000 ms.
