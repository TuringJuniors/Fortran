# Micro-Controller-one-way-traffic-light-
Exercise on one way traffic lighting with pedestrian crossing lane. the RED LED last longer to give more time for pedesrian to cross.

The BRD file uses the code to help us simulate our Arduino circuit board online.
All LEDs are connected to the Ground pin and each are connected to a resistor(pull ups) to protect it from a damaging current.
RED LED is connectet to pin 13, YELLOW LED to pin 12, YELLOW2 to pin 11 and GREEN LED to pin 10.

Our code is comprising of a void loop and switch case statement which uses a digitalwrite and delay function to turn the LEDs on and off with a delay.
